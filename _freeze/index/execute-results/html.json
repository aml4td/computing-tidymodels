The structure is similar to the website, but the content here shows how to use this software (and sometimes others) for each topic. \n\nWe also want these materials to be reusable and open. The sources are in the source [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aml4td/computing-tidymodels) with a Creative Commons license attached (see below).\n\nTo cite this work, we suggest: \n\n\n```{bib}\n@online{aml4td.tidymodels,\n  Author = {Kuhn, M and Johnson, K},\n  title = {{Tidymodels Computing Supplement to Applied Machine Learning for Tabular Data}},\n  year = {2023},\n  url = { https://tidymodels.aml4td.org},\n  urldate = {2023-11-23}\n}\n```\n\n\n## License {.unnumbered}\n\n <p xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" >This work is licensed under <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"license noopener noreferrer\" style=\"display:inline-block;\">CC BY-SA 4.0<img style=\"height:22px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;\" src=\"https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/cc.svg?ref=chooser-v1\"><img style=\"height:22px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;\" src=\"https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/by.svg?ref=chooser-v1\"><img style=\"height:22px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;\" src=\"https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/sa.svg?ref=chooser-v1\"></a></p> \n\n## Intended Audience {.unnumbered}\n\nReaders should have used R before but do not have to be experts. If you are new to R, we suggest taking a look at _R for Data Science_. \n\nYou do not have to be a modeling expert either. We hope that you have used a linear or logistic regression before and understand basic statistical concepts such as correlation, variability, probabilities, etc. \n\n## How can I ask questions? \n\nIf you have questions about the content, it is probably best to ask on a public forum, like [cross-validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/) or [Posit Community](https://community.rstudio.com/c/ml/15). You'll most likely get a faster answer there if you take the time to ask the questions in the best way possible.   \n\nIf you want a direct answer from us, you should follow what I call [_Yihui's Rule_](https://yihui.org/en/2017/08/so-gh-email/): add an issue to GitHub (labeled as \"Discussion\") first. It may take some time for us to get back to you. \n\nIf you think there is a bug, please [file an issue](https://github.com//aml4td/computing-tidymodels/issues). \n\n## Can I contribute?  {.unnumbered}\n\nThere is a [contributing page](chapters/contributing.html) with details on how to get up and running to compile the materials (there are a lot of software dependencies) and suggestions on how to help. \n\nIf you just want to fix a typo, you can make a pull request to alter the appropriate `.qmd` file. \n\nPlease feel free to improve the quality of this content by submitting **pull requests**. A merged PR will make you appear in the contributor list. \n\n## Computing Notes {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n\n\n[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) was used to compile and render the materials\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nQuarto 1.4.510\n[✓] Checking versions of quarto binary dependencies...\n      Pandoc version 3.1.9: OK\n      Dart Sass version 1.69.5: OK\n      Deno version 1.37.2: OK\n[✓] Checking versions of quarto dependencies......OK\n[✓] Checking Quarto installation......OK\n      Version: 1.4.510\n[✓] Checking tools....................OK\n      TinyTeX: (external install)\n      Chromium: (not installed)\n[✓] Checking LaTeX....................OK\n      Using: TinyTex\n      Version: 2023\n[✓] Checking basic markdown render....OK\n[✓] Checking Python 3 installation....OK\n      Version: 3.11.6\n      Jupyter: (None)\n      Jupyter is not available in this Python installation.\n[✓] Checking R installation...........OK\n      Version: 4.3.2\n      LibPaths:\n      knitr: 1.45\n      rmarkdown: 2.25\n[✓] Checking Knitr engine render......OK\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) was used for the majority of the computations.
